## Prerequisites

Before you install Jupyter Notebook, ensure that you have Python installed. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).

## Installation

You can install Jupyter Notebook using pip, the Python package installer. Follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Install Pip

If you haven't installed pip, you can install it using the following commands:

```sh
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python get-pip.py
```

### Step 2: Install Jupyter Notebook

Once pip is installed, you can install Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:

```sh
pip install notebook
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

To verify the installation, run the following command to check the version of Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
jupyter --version
```

You should see output that includes the version numbers of Jupyter Notebook and its dependencies.

## Running Jupyter Notebook

To start Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the directory where you want to save your notebooks and run the following command:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

This command will start the Jupyter Notebook server and open a new tab in your default web browser. The Jupyter Notebook interface should appear.

## Creating and Managing Notebooks

### Creating a New Notebook

To create a new notebook, click on the "New" button in the top right corner of the Jupyter Notebook interface and select "Python 3" (or the version of Python you are using).

### Naming Your Notebook

To rename your notebook, click on the title (which defaults to "Untitled") at the top of the notebook and enter a new name.

### Saving Your Notebook

Notebooks are automatically saved periodically, but you can also save them manually by clicking on the "Save" icon or pressing `Ctrl + S`.

### Running Cells

You can run a cell by selecting it and clicking the "Run" button or by pressing `Shift + Enter`.

### Adding Text and Code Cells

You can add new cells by clicking the "+" button. By default, new cells are code cells. To change a cell to a Markdown cell, select the cell and choose "Markdown" from the dropdown menu.
