## Introduction

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It's used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

## Getting Started

### Installing Python

Download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/). Make sure to check the option to add Python to your PATH.

### Writing Your First Program

You can write Python code in various environments, such as:

- IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment)
- Text editors like Sublime Text, Atom, or Visual Studio Code
- Jupyter Notebooks

Let's start with a simple program:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Save the file with a `.py` extension and run it using the command line:

```sh
python filename.py
```

## Basic Syntax

### Comments

Comments are lines of code that are not executed. They are used to explain code.

```python
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a 
multi-line comment
"""
```

### Indentation

Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. Proper indentation is crucial.

```python
if True:
    print("This is indented")
```

## Data Types

Python has various data types including:

- Integers: `int`
- Floating-point numbers: `float`
- Strings: `str`
- Booleans: `bool`

### Examples

```python
x = 10      # int
y = 3.14    # float
name = "Alice"  # str
is_valid = True  # bool
```

## Variables

Variables store data that can be used and modified. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type.

```python
age = 25
name = "John"
height = 5.9
```

## Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Modulus: `%`
- Exponentiation: `**`
- Floor division: `//`

### Comparison Operators

- Equal: `==`
- Not equal: `!=`
- Greater than: `>`
- Less than: `<`
- Greater than or equal to: `>=`
- Less than or equal to: `<=`

### Logical Operators

- And: `and`
- Or: `or`
- Not: `not`

### Examples

```python
a = 10
b = 20

# Arithmetic
print(a + b)  # 30
print(a - b)  # -10
print(a * b)  # 200
print(a / b)  # 0.5

# Comparison
print(a == b)  # False
print(a != b)  # True
print(a > b)   # False

# Logical
print(a > 5 and b < 30)  # True
print(not (a > 5))       # False
```

## Control Flow

### If Statements

```python
x = 10

if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif x == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Negative")
```

### While Loop

```python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

### For Loop

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

## Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code.

### Defining a Function

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")
```

### Return Statement

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # 8
```

## Lists

Lists are ordered collections of items.

### Creating a List

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Accessing Elements

```python
print(numbers[0])  # 1
print(numbers[-1])  # 5
```

### Modifying Lists

```python
numbers.append(6)
numbers.remove(3)
print(numbers)  # [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries store key-value pairs.

### Creating a Dictionary

```python
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 25,
    "city": "New York"
}
```

### Accessing Values

```python
print(person["name"])  # Alice
print(person.get("age"))  # 25
```

### Modifying Dictionaries

```python
person["age"] = 26
person["email"] = "alice@example.com"
print(person)
```

## Loops

### For Loop

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### While Loop

```python
count = 0

while count < 3:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've covered the basics of Python. Keep practicing by working on small projects and exploring more advanced topics. Happy coding!
